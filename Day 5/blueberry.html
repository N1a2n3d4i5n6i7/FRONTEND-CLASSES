        <h2> Blueberries History </h2>
        <p> Blueberries are usually prostrate shrubs that can vary in size from 10 centimeters (4 inches) to 4 meters (13 feet) in height.<br> In commercial production of blueberries, the species with small, pea-size berries growing on low-level bushes are known as "lowbush blueberries", while the species with larger berries growing on taller, cultivated bushes are known as "highbush blueberries".<br> Canada is the leading producer of lowbush blueberries, while the United States produces some 40% of the world supply of highbush blueberries.</p>
