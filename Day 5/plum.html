        <h2> Plum History</h2>
        <p>Plums belong to the same family as peaches, nectarines, and apricots.<br> But plums are much more diverse than their stone-fruit cousins.<br> They can be large or small, with red, purple, green, yellow, or orange skin, and pink, yellow, or orange flesh.<br> They first grew in China thousands of years ago. </p>
