        <p> The avocado (Persea americana) is a medium-sized, evergreen tree in the laurel family (Lauraceae).<br> It is native to the Americas and was first domesticated in Mesoamerica more than 5,000 years ago. Then as now it was prized for its large and unusually oily fruit<br> The tree likely originated in the highlands bridging south-central Mexico and Guatemala.<br> Its fruit, sometimes also referred to as an alligator pear or avocado pear, is botanically a large berry containing a single large seed.<br> Avocado trees are partly self-pollinating, and are often propagated through grafting to maintain consistent fruit output.</p>
